            <h1>Python Basics</h1>
            <p>
                Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy
                emphasizes
                code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and
                object-oriented
                approach
                aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]
    
                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured
                (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a
                "batteries
                included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]
    
                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980's, as a successor to the ABC programming language,
                and
                first
                released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such
                as
                list
                comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting and was discontinued with version
                2.7.18
                in
                2020.[33] Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely
                backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
    
                Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

            <p>
                Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI
                toolkit,[1] and is
                Python's de facto standard GUI.[2] Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X
                installs of
                Python.
    
                The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. Tkinter was written by Fredrik Lundh.[3]

                The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for
                documents designed
                to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.
    
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
                multimedia web
                pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
                appearance of the
                document.
    
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
                interactive
                forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
                denoting
                structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
                elements are
                delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and directly introduce content into
                the
                page. Other tags such as
            <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as
                sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
                content
                of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
                former
                maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
                explicit
                presentational HTML since 1997.[2]

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a
                markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.[2]
    
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This
                separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
                presentation
                characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
                .css file
                which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be
                cached to
                improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for
                different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
                reader), and on
                Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a
                mobile
                device.[4]
    
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
                than one rule
                matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
    
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css
                is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
                ECMAScript
                specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
                curly-bracket
                syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript
                enables
                interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
                client-side
                page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
    
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
                structures,
                and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
                facilities. In
                practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other
                runtime systems,
                such as Node.js and Deno. These systems are used to build servers and are also integrated into frameworks,
                such as
                Electron and Cordova, for creating a variety of applications.
    
                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
                standard
                libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
